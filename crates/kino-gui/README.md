# kino-gui

_kino-gui_ is a 2D UI immediate mode library that is wgpu native and game design oriented. Named after the sap that comes out of a 
eucalyptus tree, this library can be used to create 2D designs, create HUDs for a 3D map or create menus for 2D contexts. 

This library is simple to use, and designs itself to be "injected" as an overlay with your surface. 

## Note
It is a heavy WIP, and there are many features still not done yet.
