# eucalyptus-editor

The primary editor used to make games on the dropbear engine. It is scripted in Kotlin and is JVM first-party
supported. 

## Other functions

To run a local play test, run `eucalyptus-editor.exe play {project_dir}` with optional jvm args specified through
`--jvm-args {jvm_args}`. 

eucalyptus-editor does not have a scripting interface, therefore can be run without the Java Virtual Machine. If you do
wish to enter into "Play Mode" or start testing your game, you will require a form of Java Development Kit (JDK).
